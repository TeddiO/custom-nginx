# About
Builds a statically linked version of nginx complete with the [ngx_http_substitutions](https://github.com/yaoweibin/ngx_http_substitutions_filter_module) module and the [ngx_headers_more](https://github.com/openresty/headers-more-nginx-module) module, alongside setting groups for HTTP purposes. This version of nginx will only run you 10-15mb in size and _only_ contains a compiled nginx.
